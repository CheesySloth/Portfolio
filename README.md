**CheesySloth Portfolio Website: Design 1**
<p>This portfolio design was inspired by Ania Kubow's tutorial that is no longer available.</p>

I have adapted it to practice elements of CSS. In particular it features a carousel typewriter on the main page. This was developed in part because it looks cool but mostly for me to learn the relationships between different divs, classes and css animations. This has been achieved thanks to:

[Sabine Robart](https://codepen.io/_Sabine/pen/xmxEqP).

[Matt Nikonorov](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-typewriter-effect/).

The font colours included are inspired by phosphor monitors and the specific hexcodes were listed by [Journeyman Geek](https://superuser.com/questions/361297/what-colour-is-the-dark-green-on-old-fashioned-green-screen-computer-displays).

TODO:
- Add dropdown for projects to list featured as well as all.
- Create projects page where projects can be viewed in a list.
- Tidy up footer and add contact form.
- Finish and upload TATIANA (separate related blog project).
- Update Linkedin
- Add real projects

> Stay cheesy :)
