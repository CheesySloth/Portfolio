**CheesySloth Portfolio Website: Design 1**
This portfolio design was inspired by Ania Kubow @ https://youtu.be/-D6oTPA4vXc

I have adapted it to practice elements of CSS. In particular it features a carousel typewriter on the main page. This was developed in part because it looks cool but mostly for me to learn the relationships between different divs, classes and css animations. This has been achieved by combining elements of the following projects:

https://codepen.io/_Sabine/pen/xmxEqP by Sabine Robart

https://www.sitepoint.com/css-typewriter-effect/ by Matt Nikonorov

The font colours included are inspired by phosphor monitors and the specific hexcodes were listed by Journeyman Geek @ https://superuser.com/questions/361297/what-colour-is-the-dark-green-on-old-fashioned-green-screen-computer-displays
